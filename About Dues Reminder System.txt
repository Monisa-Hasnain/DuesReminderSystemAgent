I was creating an app for my client who sells his item on installments and keep track of his customers due dates and amounts.
so this idea clicks me if i automate his reminders so he does not have to check his sheets for dues daily. 


1. customer Name , email , due date , due amount , status  fields in google sheet
2. n8n will check the sheet filters the rows where at least 2 days left in due date. if less then or equal to 2 days left for due date and due amount is    greater then 0 and status in not 'Paid' , it will send reminder email to customer. 
3. if due date is passed n8n agent will generate and send email to manager telling customer's due amount, due date and status of payment.
4. run the agent daily at 9am.
